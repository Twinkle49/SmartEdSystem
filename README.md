📂 Navigate to the project directory using the cd command in your terminal to access the project files.

💻 Activate a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated. Create a virtual environment by running python -m venv env, and then activate it. On Windows, use .\env\Scripts\activate, and on macOS/Linux, use source env/bin/activate.

⚙️ Install the project dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal. This will ensure that all the required packages are installed.

🗄️ If the project uses a database, set it up according to the project's instructions. You may need to create a new database and configure the settings accordingly.

🛠️ Apply the database migrations by running python manage.py migrate in your terminal. This will create the necessary tables in the database.

👑 If you need administrative access, create a superuser account by running python manage.py createsuperuser and follow the prompts to set up a username and password.

▶️ Start the development server by running python manage.py runserver in your terminal. The server will start, and you'll see a local URL (usually http://localhost:8000) where you can access the project.
